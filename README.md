# asm

This is a "hello world" project to play with Rust inline assembly.
[Inline assembly](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/24/Rust-1.59.0.html#whats-in-1590-stable)
was introduced with Rust 1.59 release (2022-02-24)
and this is an attempt to learn more about it.

Inspiration from this little project also comes from
[@iMilnb](https://twitter.com/iMilnb)
and the C From Scratch video series, mainly this
show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Ow6-uH6Mc

The goal of the project is to show:
* How to call the `write` and `uname` syscall directly using assembly.
* How to use raw pointers and a bit of FFI (Foreign Fonction Interface)
  to share data.
* Usage of unsafe in such cases.
* Implementation of the From trait to convert data from the C style
  structure to the Rust one. This part is shamefully more or less
  copied from the uname crate.

The asm directory contains a "hello world" example written in
assembly and was used as a reference for the project.

The project uses x86_64 assembly and is targeting a Linux x86_64
operating system. It means that **it will not be able to run** on
another platform or CPU.

Of course, tracing the program with `stace` shows
the syscalls explicitly requested with inline assembly :
```
execve("./target/debug/asm", ["./target/debug/asm"], 0x7fff86007bb0 /* 90 vars */) = 0
...
...
write(1, "Hello from: ", 12Hello from: )            = 12
write(1, "\360\237\246\211 Uggla !!!\n", 15ðŸ¦‰ Uggla !!!
) = 15
uname({sysname="Linux", nodename="ugglalaptop", ...}) = 0
...
...
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

## Build from the sources

1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/uggla/asm.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd asm
```

3. Build and run the program
```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/asm
```

4. Build hello.asm within asm directory (optional)<br/>
Install make, gcc and nasm on your system using your
system package manager. Then execute :
```bash
cd asm
make
./hello
```
